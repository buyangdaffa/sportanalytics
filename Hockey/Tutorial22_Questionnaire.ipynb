    "Hi and welcome to the Sportlogiq DA Questionnaire! The goal with this questionnaire is to assess your problem solving, hockey knowledge, and coding/stats abilities and your (hopeful) fit with some of our day-to-day tasks. If you find yourself stuck or unsure on a question, showing your work and explaining your problem solving/decision making is still highly recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "Libraries:\n",
    "- You'll want to import libraries such as numpy, pandas, a plotting library like plotly/matplotlib, and a stats library of your choosing (sklearn for example)\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Info:\n",
    "- There are two data files. One has a condensed event set from a randomly chosen hockey game and the other contains Expected Goals values (xg) provided only for shots that successfully hit the net. If an xg value doesn't correspond to a shot event, it should not be counted\n",
    "\n",
    "- X and Y Coordinates are in Feet and are adjusted such that both teams shoot in the same direction\n",
    "\n",
    "- Line Carry events are tagged when the puck is carried over either blue line or the centre ice red line\n",
    "\n",
    "- Binary columns that have values of 0 or 1 indicate 0=No, 1=Yes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Successfull passes are completed passes, successful shots are shots on net\n",
    "\n",
    "Please show all work, keep written answers succinct and to the point and most of all, thanks for your time and good luck!"

    "### b) The expected goals (xG) value of this furthest goal is only 0.004219, which is relatively low compared to other goals. This is because the shot was taken from a very far distance away from the net, which makes it less likely to be converted into a goal. Additionally, the team that scored this goal was in a penalty kill situation, where they had only 4 skaters on ice, while the opposing team had 5 skaters on ice. This means that the team was at a disadvantage and had a lower probability of scoring a goal, resulting in a lower xG value."
